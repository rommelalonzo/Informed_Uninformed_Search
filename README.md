  The main purpose of this program is to perform simple Informed and Uninformed searches using templated classes. This 
program will implememt the following search algorithms:
  - Breadth First Search (Uninformed)
  - Depth First Search (Uninformed)
  - A* Search (Informed)
  - IDA Search (Informed)

  The secondary purpose of this project is to implement Design Pattern concepts into the search functionalities of the
program. The reason for trying to apply these techniques is to allow this program to be reused in various other 
applications. 
  
  The development platform used will be Eclipse since the language being used will be Java.
